Tool Objective:

Identify **YouTube Shorts** niches with high viral potential by scanning and evaluating short-form videos based on strict performance, content-style, and formatting criteria — especially **faceless** formats that are **replicable and scalable**.

---

✅ Core Functionality:

### 1. Filtering Criteria for Viral Faceless Shorts:
- ✅ **Only include YouTube Shorts**: videos **< 60 seconds**.
- ✅ **Published in the last 1–7 days** (adjustable).
- ✅ **Must be gaining at least 50,000 views/day**, or **2x view count growth daily**.
- ✅ **Exclude**: music videos, motivational speech clips, or generic gaming content (unless it’s a new trending format).
- ✅ **Faceless Filter**:
  - Use face detection on **video thumbnails** (OpenCV or Google Vision API).
  - Filter out channels where **>10% of thumbnails include faces**.
  - Optionally scan titles/descriptions for terms like “voiceover,” “animation,” “text,” or “AI,” to reinforce faceless scoring.

### 2. Channel Quality Criteria:
- ✅ **High Monthly Views**: Estimated **10M+ views/month** (from total views and upload date).
- ✅ **Low Content Volume**: Channel should have **< 20 videos total**.
- ✅ **Recent Channel Age**: Channel must be **less than 30 days old**.
- ✅ **Strong Per-Short Performance**: Each video should average **≥50K views within 7 days**.
- ✅ **Consistent Uploading**: **≥ 4 uploads/week**.

> ⚙️ All criteria above should be user-adjustable through config settings or CLI parameters.

📊 3. Viral Score Calculation:
For each qualifying channel/video, calculate a **Viral Score** using:
- Views/day since upload
- View acceleration rate (today’s growth vs. initial day)
- Engagement ratio (likes + comments / views)
- % of videos with >50K views
- Facelessness confidence score

---

📦 4. Output Results:
Group and rank by **niche/topic clusters** using tags, titles, and NLP keyword similarity (e.g., spaCy or transformers). Output Top 10 Niches:

For each niche group, display:
- Niche/topic name
- Number of qualifying viral videos
- Avg views/day
- Avg engagement ratio
- Channel names (with faceless flag and upload frequency)
- Links to top 3 videos
- Recurring keywords, phrases, or tags in titles/descriptions

---

📤 5. Output Format:
- Export full results to **CSV** (niches + channels + video stats)
- Optional: Display results in a **simple Flask web interface** for browsing
- Include **toggle for “faceless only” mode** (on by default)

---

🔍 6. Bonus Enhancements (if time permits):
- Allow the user to enter a **seed keyword or topic** to focus the search (e.g., “AI facts” or “sports”).
- Sort results by **content format niches** (e.g., reaction style, mobile game clips, quizzes, etc.)
- Add real-time “monitor mode” that flags new viral uploads daily (like a trend radar).

---

🧠 Target Outcomes:
- Discover **undiscovered YouTube Shorts formats** that are **scalable, faceless, and trending**.
- Reveal **low-saturation, high-return content niches** ideal for automated content or voiceover-based Shorts.
- Build viral channels or products before the market gets saturated.
